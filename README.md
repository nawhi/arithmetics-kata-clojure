# arithmetics-kata-clojure

The [Arithmetics kata](https://katalyst.codurance.com/arithmetics) implemented in Clojure.

My first clojure project, so bound to be littered with rookie errors.

## Kata Instructions

Create a function that can parse simple mathematical expressions in the following format:

```text
( 1 + 2 )
```

All of the operations are wrapped in parentheses and all tokens (parentheses, operands and numbers) should be separated by a space.

## Possible extensions
- Drop the requirement for every element to be space-separated.
- Drop the requirement for all operations to be wrapped in parentheses and deduce operation order from operator precedence rules instead.
